/*
I. Access Array Elements Using Pointers

Write a C Program that gets the elements of an array provided by the user,
then uses pointers to access the elements of the array and prints them in order.
Below is an example of output for this program:

Enter elements:
1
2
3
4
5

You entered:
1
2
3
4
5

Note:
1. Accept integers as array elements. Array size is set to 5 (do not accept array size)
2. Must use pointers to accept and print elements of the array
3. Display each element of the array on a new line
