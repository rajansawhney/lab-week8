/*
II. Swap Numbers

Write a C Program that swap numbers in cyclic order using a call by reference.
Below is an example of output for this program:

Enter a, b, and c respectively:
1
2
3

Value before swapping:
a=1
b=2
c=3

Value after swapping: 
a=3
b=1
c=2

Note:
1. Accept only integers
2. Must use pointers to swap numbers
3. Display a,b,c on separate lines
